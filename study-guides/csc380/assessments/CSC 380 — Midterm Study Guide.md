# CSC 380 — Midterm Study Guide (PROVISIONAL · LIGHT · date NV)

**Banner — date NEEDS VERIFICATION; scope PROVISIONAL; LIGHT guide.**
- **Date:** the syllabus says **"tentatively"** Tue Oct 20, 2026, 5:00–6:15 PM Arizona time, in the regular lecture. The calendar also lists Oct 20. The date stays **Needs verification** until the instructor confirms it.
- **Scope:** coverage is **not published**. It is provisional, from syllabus weeks 1–8: pandas, visualization, probability, random variables and distributions, covariance and correlation, and midterm review.
- **Light only:** this is a concept map plus a small practice set. Do not do dense prep that assumes a confirmed date.

## 3. Mini explanations

- **pandas.** These are standard pandas; match your class notebooks.
  - Filter rows: `df[df["age"] > 30]`
  - Select columns: `df[["a", "b"]]`
  - Group means: `df.groupby("team")["score"].mean()`
  - Missing values: `df.isna().sum()` and `df.dropna()`
- **Chart choice.**

| What you want to show | Chart |
|-----------------------|-------|
| Distribution of one numeric variable | Histogram or box plot |
| Two numeric variables | Scatter plot |
| Comparison across categories | Bar chart |
| Change over time | Line chart |

- **Combinations.** C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) counts **unordered** selections. Permutations P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)! count **ordered** ones.
- **Random variables.** For a discrete X, E[X] = sum  x·P(x). Var(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2.
- **Special distributions** (as lectured).
  - Bernoulli(p): mean p, variance p(1-p).
  - Binomial(n, p): mean np, variance np(1-p).
  - Uniform, Poisson, Normal, and Exponential follow if covered.
- **Covariance and correlation.** Cov(X, Y) = E[(X - muX)(Y - muY)]. Corr = Cov / (sigmaX·sigmaY), which always lies in [-1, 1]. Correlation measures **linear** association only. Check which denominator the course uses for sample covariance (n or n - 1).
- **Bayes, LOTP, independence.** These are the published Quiz 04 topics; see the Quiz 04 Practice Guide.

## 4. Light practice (self-contained)

**L1 (recall).** Define independence, and write correlation in terms of covariance.

**L2 (combinations).** How many 3-person committees can be chosen from 7 people? What is the probability of exactly 2 heads in 4 fair coin flips?

**L3 (random variable).** For a fair six-sided die X, find E[X] and Var(X).

**L4 (binomial).** X ~ Binomial(10, 0.3). Find E[X] and Var(X).

**L5 (covariance/correlation).** For X = [1, 2, 3] and Y = [2, 4, 6], find the sample covariance (denominator n - 1) and the correlation.

**L6 (Bayes).** P(H) = 0.2, P(E | H) = 0.9, P(E | not-H) = 0.3. Find P(H | E).

**L7 (independence).** P(A) = 0.25, P(B) = 0.4, P(A and B) = 0.1. Are A and B independent?

**L8 (visualization).** Pick a chart for (a) the distribution of house prices, (b) price vs. square footage, (c) average price by neighborhood.

**L9 (pandas).** Write one line that gives the mean `score` for each `team` in DataFrame `df`.

**L10 (planning).** Why must the tentative Oct 20 date be re-verified before making a dense plan?


**L11 (Content grain — Practice recommendation).** Two labs: Lab A has 90 students (30% prefer Python); Lab B has 60 students (70% prefer Python). (a) P(prefer Python). (b) Given prefer-Python, P(Lab B). (Cite Content quiz01_03 Quiz-03 style; numbers changed.)

## 4b. Format reminder — **Practice recommendation**

The Gradescope format notes show that quizzes are about 1.5 points on a single page, and each homework has **two** items (written and Code). The **midterm format is not published**. For practice, write L2–L7 by hand, one per half-page, with every step shown. This is a generic habit, not a claimed midterm format.

## 5. ANSWER KEY

**L1.** Independence means P(A and B) = P(A)·P(B). Corr(X, Y) = Cov(X, Y) / (sigmaX·sigmaY).

**L2.** C(7, 3) = 35. P(exactly 2 heads in 4 flips) = C(4, 2)/2^4 = 6/16 = **0.375**.

**L3.** E[X] = 3.5. E[X^2] = 91/6. Var(X) = 91/6 - 12.25 = **35/12 ≈ 2.917**.

**L4.** E[X] = 10·0.3 = **3**. Var(X) = 10·0.3·0.7 = **2.1**.

**L5.** The means are 2 and 4. The deviations are (-1, 0, 1) for X and (-2, 0, 2) for Y, so the sum of products is 2 + 0 + 2 = 4. Sample covariance = 4 / (3 - 1) = **2**. The sample standard deviations are 1 and 2, so correlation = 2 / (1·2) = **1**, a perfect positive linear relationship. With the population denominator, the covariance is 4/3, and the correlation is still 1.

**L6.** P(E) = 0.9·0.2 + 0.3·0.8 = 0.42. P(H | E) = 0.18 / 0.42 = **3/7 ≈ 0.429**.

**L7.** 0.25 × 0.4 = 0.1 = P(A and B). **Yes, independent.**

**L8.** (a) Histogram (or box plot). (b) Scatter plot. (c) Bar chart.

**L9.** `df.groupby("team")["score"].mean()`

**L10.** The syllabus marks the date as "tentative". The context rule is never to treat an unconfirmed date as fixed, so re-check on D2L, the course site, or in class during Oct 13–19 before planning around it.


**L11.** (a) 0.3*(90/150) + 0.7*(60/150) = 0.3*0.6 + 0.7*0.4 = 0.18 + 0.28 = **0.46**. (b) 0.28/0.46 = **14/23 ~= 0.609**.

## 6. Common mistakes + readiness (light)

- Studying regression or neural networks early.
- Treating the tentative Oct 20 date as fixed.
- Skipping Quiz 04 fluency, since Bayes, LOTP, and independence are the only **published** subset.
- Mixing up combinations (unordered) with permutations (ordered).
- Reading a correlation near 0 as "no relationship", when it only means no **linear** relationship.
- Inventing quiz dates from the Tuesday cadence.

**Ready (light):**
- [ ] Weeks 1–8 concept map reviewed
- [ ] Quiz 04 topics solid
- [ ] L1-L11 correct
- [ ] Date and scope re-verified during Oct 13–19 **before** densifying

## 7. Prep plan (light — no day-before cram that assumes a confirmed date)

| Window | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Now – early Oct | Quiz 04 practice and HW3/HW4 probability. **Not** a midterm marathon. |
| Sat Oct 3 | One light pass over the `380-L-*` concept map and L1–L10 |
| Tue Oct 13 | HW4 due 11:59 PM (written plus Code) |
| Oct 13–19 | **Re-verify** the date and scope on D2L, the site, or the tracker. Densify only after that. |
| If Oct 20 is confirmed | Sit the midterm at 5:00–6:15 PM. The night before, calm review only. |

Do deeper work Mon/Wed/Fri and weekends; keep Tuesdays and Thursdays light.

## 8. Changes in this review (2026-09-24)

- Kept the **date NV** and **LIGHT** banners unchanged in meaning. Changed "PT" to Arizona time.
- **Made the answer key self-contained.** The old key said "see the Quiz 04 guide" for Bayes; all L-items now have worked answers.
- Added the week-3 **Combinations** topic, which was merged into independence and had no practice. Added practice on random variables, the binomial distribution, covariance/correlation, visualization, and pandas (L2–L5, L8–L9).
- Noted that the weeks 6–8 lectures have not happened yet.
- Kept the new practice to ten short items so the guide stays light.


## 8b. Content-fold (2026-09-24, America/Phoenix)

- Light only: cited Content quiz01_03 + HW01-03; added L11 similar-style LOTP+Bayes drill. Date/scope banners unchanged (NV / PROVISIONAL / LIGHT). No dense invent.
