## 3. Plain explanations + worked examples

### `252-T2-binary` — Binary, conversions, 2's complement (Deck 01)

**Positional value.** A digit string d_(k-1)...d0 in base b means sum di·b^i. With k digits the largest unsigned value is b^k - 1. For example, 8 bits gives 2^8 - 1 = 255.

**Hex and octal.** Group bits in fours (hex) or threes (octal), starting from the **right**.
Example: `1011 0111` = 0xB7. Grouped in threes it is `10 110 111`, which is octal 267. Both equal 183.

**Approximations.** These come up in the "conversions and approximations" style of question.

| Power | Exact | Approximate |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 2^10 | 1,024 | ~= 1 thousand |
| 2^20 | 1,048,576 | ~= 1 million |
| 2^30 | 1,073,741,824 | ~= 1 billion |
| 2^32 | 4,294,967,296 | ~= 4 billion |

To approximate 2^n, split n into a multiple of 10 plus a remainder. For example, 2^34 = 2^4·2^30 ~= 16 billion.

**2's complement (k bits).**
- The range is -2^(k-1) to 2^(k-1) - 1. For 8 bits that is -128 to 127.
- **Negative or not:** the value is negative exactly when the most significant bit (MSB) is 1. You do not need to convert the number to decide.
- **Negate:** invert every bit, then add 1. Example: +5 = `0101`, inverted is `1010`, plus 1 gives `1011` = -5 (4-bit).
- **Special patterns:** all 1s is -1. `1000...0` is the most negative value and has no positive partner, because negating it gives itself.
- **Sign-extend:** copy the sign bit into the new high bits. For example, 4-bit `1011` (-5) becomes 8-bit `1111 1011` (still -5).

**Binary addition.** Work right to left. A column that sums to 2 or 3 writes 0 or 1 and carries 1.

```
  0110   (6)
+ 0101   (5)
------
  1011   (11)
```

**Two kinds of overflow.** They answer different questions.
- **Unsigned overflow** happens when there is a carry out of the MSB. The true sum does not fit in k bits.
- **Signed overflow** happens when the two inputs have the **same sign** but the result has the **opposite sign**. Adding numbers of opposite signs can never overflow.

**Binary subtraction.** Compute A - B as A + (-B): invert B, add 1, then add.
- In this method, carry-out = 1 means **no borrow** (A >= B as unsigned). Carry-out = 0 means a borrow happened.
- Signed overflow in subtraction occurs when A and B have **different** signs and the result's sign differs from A's.

### `252-T2-mips-intro` — Intro MIPS (Deck 02)

- Memory is an array of bytes. A word is 4 bytes, so word addresses step by 4.
- MIPS is a RISC design. ALU instructions only operate on registers; only loads and stores touch memory.
- The register file includes `$zero` (always 0), `$t0–$t9` (temporaries), and `$s0–$s7` (saved). Use the names exactly as the slides do.
- **Immediates are 16-bit signed.** This is why MIPS has `addi` but no real `subi`: to subtract a constant, add a negative one (`addi $t0, $t1, -7`). MARS may accept `subi` as a pseudo-instruction, but it is not a real instruction and is usually not on the allowable list.
- `slt rd, rs, rt` sets rd to 1 if rs < rt, else 0. Combined with `beq`/`bne` against `$zero`, it replaces pseudo-branches like `blt`.

**Allowable instructions.** Test 1 printed an allowable-instruction list on its cover. Practice as if Test 2 does the same: `add`, `addi`, `sub`, `and`, `andi`, `or`, `ori`, `xor`, `nor`, `sll`, `srl`, `sra`, `slt`, `slti`, `lw`, `sw`, `lb`, `sb`, `beq`, `bne`, `j`, `la`, `syscall`. **Check the real cover sheet on test day.** This list is a practice assumption, not a published Test 2 list.

### `252-T2-gates` — Gates and adders (Deck 03)

- **Sum of products:** for each truth-table row that outputs 1, AND the inputs together (inverting any that are 0), then OR those terms.
- **Half adder:** Sum = A XOR B; Carry = A AND B.
- **Full adder:** Sum = A XOR B XOR Cin; Cout = (A AND B) OR (A AND Cin) OR (B AND Cin). This is the majority function.
- **Ripple-carry adder:** chain full adders so each Cout feeds the next bit's Cin.

**Full adder truth table (complete):**

| A | B | Cin | Sum | Cout |
|---|---|-----|-----|------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Sum is 1 when an odd number of inputs are 1. Cout is 1 when at least two inputs are 1.

### `252-T2-mips-loops` — Loops, arrays, bit shifting (Deck 04)

- **Loop shape:** initialize, test (branch **out** when the condition is false), body, update, then `j` back to the test.
- **Array element i:** address = base + i·4 for words (`sll $t1, $t0, 2` then `add`). For bytes (such as string characters) the address is base + i with `lb`/`sb`.
- **Short-circuit conditions.**
  - For `A && B`: if A is false, skip to the else/end immediately.
  - For `A || B`: if A is true, jump into the body immediately.
- **Shifts:**
  - `sll` by k multiplies by 2^k, provided no 1-bits fall off the top.
  - `srl` by k divides an **unsigned** value by 2^k.
  - `sra` keeps the sign bit, so it suits signed division (rounding toward -inf).
- **Masks:** `andi` with 0xF keeps the low 4 bits. `ori` sets bits. `xor` with all 1s flips bits.

**Worked example — `if (x == y && a < b) body;`** with x, y, a, b in `$s0–$s3`:

```
      bne  $s0, $s1, SKIP      # x != y  -> whole && is false
      slt  $t0, $s2, $s3       # t0 = (a < b)
      beq  $t0, $zero, SKIP    # a >= b  -> false
      # ... body ...
SKIP:
```

## 4. Practice questions (core)

Attempt these **blind**, on paper, before looking at §5.

**P1 (recall / binary):** What is the largest unsigned value with 8 bits?

**P2 (solve / binary):** Convert decimal 43 to 8-bit binary and to hex.

**P3 (solve / 2's complement):** In 8-bit 2's complement, what is -17? Show invert-then-add-1 starting from +17.

**P4 (explain / overflow):** When does signed overflow happen for addition? How is that different from unsigned overflow?

**P5 (recall / gates):** Give the Sum and Carry expressions for a half adder.

**P6 (trace / full adder):** For A=1, B=0, Cin=1, what are Sum and Cout?

**P7 (explain / MIPS intro):** Why does MIPS keep load/store separate from ALU instructions?

**P8 (code / MIPS):** Write a loop that sums N words. The base address is in `$s0`, the count in `$s1`, and the result goes in `$s2`.

**P9 (trace / arrays):** A word array starts at `0x10010000`. What is the byte address of element i = 3 (0-based)?

**P10 (explain / shifts):** Why does shifting left by 1 multiply an unsigned value by 2, and when does that fail?

**P11 (trace / branches):** For `if (x != y || a < b)`, when can the second check be skipped?

**P12 (recall / logistics):** When is Test 2, and how long is it?

## 4b. Gradescope-format practice — **Practice recommendation**

**Where this format comes from.** It is inferred from the **Test 1 result structure** in the Gradescope format notes. Test 1 was a scanned hand-written paper of about 6 pages with four 25-point questions. Your graded feedback listed these themes:
- Question 1 (short concepts: 2's complement, `&` vs `&&`, "negative or not", binary patterns, SUBI) was the **largest loss**.
- Binary Subtraction and C-to-MIPS also lost points.
- Sim 1 autograder failures clustered on 2's complement and SUB.

The groups below weight those themes. **This is not a published Test 2 blueprint**, and four equal buckets is **not** a confirmed Test 2 format. Topics stay inside provisional Decks 01–04.

**Timed mock (recommended once, on Mon Sep 28):** on blank paper, do A4, A5, A6, B2, B5, C3, C4, and D4 in **25 minutes**. Write by hand, since Test 1 was scanned paper.

### Group A — Short concepts (Test 1 Question 1 themes)

**GS-A1.** In one sentence each: (i) what does sign extension do when widening a 2's complement value? (ii) how does `&` differ from `&&`?

**GS-A2.** What extra input does a full adder have compared with a half adder? Why do all bits after the least significant bit need full adders?

**GS-A3.** If each word is 4 bytes, how do you turn array index `i` into a byte offset in MIPS?

**GS-A4 (negative or not).** Treat each value as an 8-bit 2's complement pattern. Is it negative? `0x7F`, `0x80`, `0xFF`, `0x3C`.

**GS-A5 (SUBI).** MIPS has `addi` but no real `subi`. Write one instruction for `$t0 = $t1 - 7`, and explain why MIPS does not need `subi`.

**GS-A6 (`&` vs `&&`).** Evaluate in C: `6 & 3`, `6 && 3`, `4 & 2`, `4 && 2`. What bug does the last pair illustrate?

**GS-A7 (binary patterns).** For 8-bit 2's complement, give the bit patterns for (i) the most negative value, (ii) -1, (iii) the largest positive value. Which value has no positive counterpart?

### Group B — Conversions and approximations

**GS-B1.** Convert unsigned decimal 157 to 8-bit binary and to hex. Show the grouping.

**GS-B2.** Interpret `1101 0110` as (i) unsigned decimal and (ii) 8-bit 2's complement decimal. Show work.

**GS-B3.** Which power of two is closest to 1000?

**GS-B4.** About how large is 2^32? Estimate without a calculator and say how you split the exponent.

**GS-B5.** What is the minimum number of bits needed to give 3,000,000 items distinct unsigned IDs?

**GS-B6.** Convert `0xB7` to binary, to decimal, and to octal.

### Group C — Binary arithmetic (subtraction emphasis)

**GS-C1.** Add unsigned 8-bit `0110 1101` + `0011 1010`. Show carries. Give the sum in binary and decimal.

**GS-C2.** Add 8-bit 2's complement `0101 1100` + `0011 0101`. Does signed overflow occur? Explain in one sentence.

**GS-C3.** Subtract unsigned 8-bit `1001 0110` - `0010 1101`. Show borrows, or use 2's complement addition. Give the difference in binary and decimal.

**GS-C4.** Compute `0x25 - 0x3A` in 8 bits using "invert, add 1, add". Give the result pattern and its signed value. Did a borrow occur, and how does the carry-out tell you?

**GS-C5.** In 8-bit signed arithmetic, compute 100 - (-50) using bit patterns. Does signed overflow occur? How can you tell from the signs alone?

### Group D — C-to-MIPS (allowable-instruction practice)

Use only the practice allowable list from §3. Do not use pseudo-branches such as `blt` or `bge`.

**GS-D1.** Write `$t0 = ($t1 < $t2) ? 1 : 0` in one instruction.

**GS-D2.** Trace: `$s0 = 0x10010000`, `$t0 = 2`, then `sll $t1,$t0,2` / `add $t1,$s0,$t1` / `lw $t2,0($t1)`. What byte address is loaded?

**GS-D3.** Write a 3–4 instruction loop that counts `$t0` down to 0.

**GS-D4 (full translation).** With `$s0 = arr` (int array), `$s1 = n`, and `$s2 = count`, translate:

```c
count = 0;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    if (arr[i] < 0)
        count++;
```

**GS-D5 (short-circuit OR).** With a, b, c, d, x in `$s0–$s4`, translate `if (a == b || c < d) x = 1;`

**GS-D6 (bit field).** Put bits 4–7 of `$s0` into the low bits of `$t0`, i.e. `$t0 = ($s0 >> 4) & 0xF`.

### Hand-in habit (Homework-style) — Practice recommendation

The Gradescope Homework 2 upload dialog asks for **images per question or one PDF**, then asks you to **assign PDF pages to questions**. When you practice on paper, put each question on its own page and label it, so page assignment is fast when you submit real homework. **Do not submit this guide or its answers.**

## 5. ANSWER KEY (separate — check only after a blind attempt)

### Core keys

**A1.** 2^8 - 1 = 255.

**A2.** 43 = 32 + 8 + 2 + 1, so `0010 1011` = `0x2B`.

**A3.** +17 = `0001 0001`. Inverted: `1110 1110`. Plus 1: `1110 1111` = -17.

**A4.** Signed overflow happens when two same-sign inputs give an opposite-sign result (two positives giving a negative, or two negatives giving a positive). Unsigned overflow is a carry out of the MSB. One sum can have either kind, both, or neither.

**A5.** Sum = A XOR B; Carry = A AND B.

**A6.** Sum = 1 XOR 0 XOR 1 = 0. Cout = majority(1, 0, 1) = 1.

**A7.** Keeping ALU instructions register-only, with explicit load/store, keeps instructions simple and uniform. That is the RISC trade-off: simpler, faster hardware.

**A8.**

```
      add  $s2, $zero, $zero    # sum = 0
      add  $t0, $zero, $zero    # i = 0
LOOP: beq  $t0, $s1, DONE       # i == n -> done
      sll  $t1, $t0, 2          # byte offset = i*4
      add  $t1, $s0, $t1        # &arr[i]
      lw   $t2, 0($t1)
      add  $s2, $s2, $t2
      addi $t0, $t0, 1
      j    LOOP
DONE:
```

**A9.** Offset = 3 x 4 = 12 = 0xC, so the address is `0x1001000C`.

**A10.** Each bit moves to the next higher power of 2, and a 0 enters at the bottom, so the value doubles. It fails (overflows) when a 1-bit is shifted out of the top.

**A11.** If `x != y` is already true, the whole OR is true, so skip the `a < b` test and enter the body.

**A12.** Thu Oct 1, 2026, during lecture (class meets 9:30–10:45 AM). The test is 25 minutes. The exact clock time within lecture is not published.

### Gradescope-format keys

**GS-A1.** (i) It copies the sign bit into the new high bits, so the value is unchanged. (ii) `&` is bitwise AND on every bit pair. `&&` is logical AND: the result is 0 or 1, and the right side is skipped if the left side is false.

**GS-A2.** The full adder adds a carry-in (Cin). Every bit after the least significant must add the carry coming from the bit below it.

**GS-A3.** Byte offset = i x 4, usually `sll $t1, $t0, 2`.

**GS-A4.** `0x7F` = 127, not negative. `0x80` = -128, negative. `0xFF` = -1, negative. `0x3C` = 60, not negative. Only the MSB matters.

**GS-A5.** `addi $t0, $t1, -7`. The 16-bit immediate is signed, so adding a negative constant already does subtraction, and a separate opcode is unnecessary.

**GS-A6.** `6 & 3` = `110 & 011` = `010` = 2. `6 && 3` = 1. `4 & 2` = `100 & 010` = 0. `4 && 2` = 1. The last pair shows the bug: two "true" values can AND bitwise to 0 (false), so using `&` where you meant `&&` changes the program's logic.

**GS-A7.** (i) `1000 0000` = -128. (ii) `1111 1111`. (iii) `0111 1111` = 127. -128 has no positive counterpart, because +128 does not fit in 8 bits.

**GS-B1.** 157 = 128 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1, so `1001 1101` = `0x9D`.

**GS-B2.** Unsigned: 128 + 64 + 16 + 4 + 2 = 214. Signed: the MSB is 1, so it is negative. Invert to `0010 1001`, add 1 to get `0010 1010` = 42, so the value is **-42**. Check: 214 - 256 = -42.

**GS-B3.** 2^10 = 1024.

**GS-B4.** 2^32 = 2^2 · 2^30 ~= 4 x 1 billion ~= 4 billion. The exact value is 4,294,967,296.

**GS-B5.** 22 bits. 2^21 ~= 2.1 million is too small, and 2^22 ~= 4.2 million is enough.

**GS-B6.** `1011 0111` = 183. Grouped in threes: `10 110 111`, octal **267**. Check: 2·64 + 6·8 + 7 = 183.

**GS-C1.** 109 + 58 = 167 = `1010 0111`. There is no carry out, so no unsigned overflow.

**GS-C2.** `0x5C + 0x35 = 0x91` = `1001 0001`. **Yes, signed overflow:** both inputs are positive (MSB 0), but the result's MSB is 1 (negative).

**GS-C3.** 150 - 45 = 105 = `0110 1001`.

**GS-C4.** -`0x3A`: `0011 1010` inverted is `1100 0101`, plus 1 is `1100 0110` (0xC6). Then `0010 0101 + 1100 0110 = 1110 1011` = `0xEB`. As a signed value that is 235 - 256 = **-21** (check: 37 - 58 = -21). The carry-out is **0**, which means a borrow occurred: as unsigned values, 37 < 58.

**GS-C5.** -(-50) = +50 = `0011 0010`, and 100 = `0110 0100`. Their sum is `1001 0110` = 0x96, which reads as -106. **Signed overflow:** a positive minus a negative must be positive, but the result is negative. The true answer, 150, exceeds 127.

**GS-D1.** `slt $t0, $t1, $t2`

**GS-D2.** 2 x 4 = 8, so the address is `0x10010008`.

**GS-D3.**

```
LOOP: beq  $t0, $zero, DONE
      addi $t0, $t0, -1
      j    LOOP
DONE:
```

**GS-D4.**

```
      addi $s2, $zero, 0        # count = 0
      addi $t0, $zero, 0        # i = 0
LOOP: slt  $t1, $t0, $s1        # t1 = (i < n)
      beq  $t1, $zero, DONE     # exit when !(i < n)
      sll  $t2, $t0, 2          # i*4
      add  $t2, $s0, $t2        # &arr[i]
      lw   $t3, 0($t2)          # arr[i]
      slt  $t4, $t3, $zero      # t4 = (arr[i] < 0)
      beq  $t4, $zero, NEXT
      addi $s2, $s2, 1          # count++
NEXT: addi $t0, $t0, 1          # i++
      j    LOOP
DONE:
```

Graders usually check three things: the loop test exits on the **false** condition, the offset is x4, and `i++` runs on both paths.

**GS-D5.**

```
      beq  $s0, $s1, THEN       # a == b -> OR already true
      slt  $t0, $s2, $s3        # t0 = (c < d)
      beq  $t0, $zero, END      # both false -> skip
THEN: addi $s4, $zero, 1        # x = 1
END:
```

**GS-D6.** `srl $t0, $s0, 4` then `andi $t0, $t0, 0xF`. If `andi` is not allowed, use `addi $t1, $zero, 15` then `and $t0, $t0, $t1`.

## 6. Common mistakes + readiness checklist

### Common mistakes

- Forgetting a carry when a column sums to 2 or 3.
- Mixing up the unsigned range (0–255) with the signed range (-128 to 127).
- Converting a number fully just to decide whether it is negative. Only the MSB matters.
- Using the carry-out to judge **signed** overflow. Carry-out only tells you about unsigned overflow and borrow.
- Sign-extending with 0s instead of copying the sign bit.
- Writing `subi` or `blt` when they are not on the allowable list.
- Forgetting x4 for word offsets (or wrongly applying x4 to byte/char arrays).
- Loop tests that branch out on the **true** condition, which inverts the loop.
- Evaluating both sides of `&&` / `||` instead of short-circuiting.

### Readiness checklist

- [ ] Blind pass over all five section IDs
- [ ] Every Group A item answered correctly from memory (the biggest Test 1 loss area)
- [ ] Two subtraction problems done both ways (borrow method and invert-add-1)
- [ ] GS-D4 written from scratch with no notes
- [ ] Full-adder table and equations redrawn from memory
- [ ] One 25-minute timed paper mock (Mon Sep 28)
- [ ] Logistics: Oct 1 in lecture, sleep, no new topics Wednesday night

## 8. Changes in this review (2026-09-24)

- Changed all times from "PT" to Arizona time. The context file says America/Phoenix. Clock times match Pacific until Nov 1.
- Added nearby deadlines from the inventory, including the Asm 2 5:00 PM vs 7:00 PM conflict (prefer Gradescope; finish by 5:00 PM to be safe).
- Completed the full-adder truth table, which previously had four missing rows.
- Removed LaTeX markup that printed literally in the PDF.
- Added explanations of subtraction, unsigned vs signed overflow, "negative or not", approximations, and why there is no `subi`.
- Added practice items GS-A4–A7, B4–B6, C4–C5, and D4–D6, plus a 25-minute timed mock. These target your own Test 1 and Sim 1 feedback themes, and all have answer keys.
- Numeric grades are described in words only, because this review copy lives in a public repository.
- Noted Deck 05 (ALU) as linked that week but **not** claimed as Test 2 scope.
