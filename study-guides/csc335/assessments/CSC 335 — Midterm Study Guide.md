# CSC 335 — Midterm Study Guide

## Start Here

**Guide updated:** 2026-09-24 afternoon (America/Phoenix) -- Start Here rewrite.

### Next scheduled assessment

| Field | Value | Label |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Assessment | CSC 335 Midterm Exam | confirmed item |
| Date | **Thu Oct 8, 2026** | **confirmed** (D2L / syllabus); closed-book in-class per D2L lessons note |
| Time | Class period 12:30-1:45 PM is the meeting; exact start **TBD** | clock **NV** |
| Format / materials | Closed-book stated on tracker; length **not** in inventory | **verify** in class / D2L |
| Coverage | Decks on box (Intro, OOP, Classes 1-2, Testing & Javadoc) plus syllabus weeks 1-6 | **PROVISIONAL -- schedule-based review** |
| Same day | CSC 345 Exam 1 is also Oct 8 (Commons 305 at 2:00 PM class) | plan energy; both clocks NV beyond class periods |

Do **not** schedule study during class blocks (Tue/Thu through Dec 9, Arizona time):
CSC 252 9:30-10:45 AM; CSC 335 12:30-1:45 PM; CSC 345 2:00-3:15 PM; CSC 337 3:30-4:45 PM; CSC 380 5:00-6:15 PM.
All times below are **Arizona (MST, UTC-7)**. Combined daily order: `weekly/2026-09-24-weekly-study-order.md`.

**Do not invent pop quizzes.** Quiz 1 window ended **Thu Sep 24 12:30** (past). P3 is syllabus-listed but **not** in D2L Assignments -- **NV**, no study time planned around it.

### Topics to study first (order + WHY)

1. **`335-M-oop` + `335-M-classes1` -- encapsulation, UML, composition** -- WHY: on-box decks exist; UML is high-yield and easy to lose; week-1 material that later patterns sit on.
2. **`335-M-testing` + `335-M-classes2` -- JUnit, Javadoc, static vs instance, exceptions** -- WHY: on-box decks; week 2-3 already lectured; tracing (T1-T4) targets these.
3. **`335-M-lambdas` + `335-M-generics`** -- WHY: syllabus weeks 3-4; **[Syllabus-only]** -- no deck on box; match lecture notation.
4. **`335-M-collections` + `335-M-javafx-obs`** -- WHY: syllabus weeks 5-6 (week 6 is Sep 29-Oct 1 -- JavaFX/Observer/Composite **as lectured**). Week 7 is review only.
5. After those: `335-M-intro` for motivation vocabulary.

**Confirmed vs schedule-based:** Date confirmed. Scope is **not published**. Rows tagged [Deck] are harvested lecture content. Rows tagged [Syllabus-only] are schedule-based review.

### Day-by-day tasks (minutes; no class-block study)

Prefer Mon/Wed/Fri and weekends. Split with 345 Exam 1. After Oct 1, 337 Midterm 1 (Oct 6) outranks 335 until Tuesday evening.

| Tue Oct 6 | 337 midterm today -- 335 is optional light after 4:45 PM | Flash only. | S1 + T2 | 15 |
| Wed Oct 7 | No class | Light mixed review. **No cram.** Sim 3 is 252's job tonight. | All IDs, light | 35 |
| Thu Oct 8 morning | Before 12:30 PM only | Calm buffer. Midterm in the 335 period (clock NV). | -- | 10 |

### Final self-check

- [ ] Blind pass over all nine section IDs
- [ ] One UML composition sketch redrawn from memory
- [ ] Three JUnit tests written (normal / edge / error)
- [ ] 50-minute mock done
- [ ] Syllabus-only topics matched to **actual lecture notation**
- [ ] P3 still treated as NV
- [ ] Energy reserved for 345 Exam 1 the same afternoon

### Slide excerpts (personal study channel only)

**Excerpt -- UML class-box vocabulary (CSC 335, Classes part 1, PDF page 2)**

![CSC 335 Classes part 1 p.2 UML](excerpts/csc335-classes1-p2-uml.png)

In my own words: a UML class box is name / fields / methods. Visibility marks are `-` private, `+` public, `#` protected. A field can also show type, multiplicity, and a default. Class diagrams show how types relate; sequence diagrams show calls over time. When you sketch `Library` composed of `Book`s, put the filled diamond on the `Library` (whole) end -- that is composition ("has-a"), not inheritance (hollow triangle).

Original deck: `/home/box/shared/munch/study-guides/_meta/d2l-harvest/csc335/csc335-classes-part1.pdf` (D2L Slides; header may show 2025 -- FA26 topic practice only), page 2. Personal study channel only.

Also review (no extra image): `csc335-oop.pdf`, `csc335-classes-part2.pdf`, `csc335-testing-and-javadoc.pdf` in the same harvest folder. JavaFX / generics / collections are syllabus-only until a deck appears.

## 3. Explanations + worked examples

### Intro / OOP (`335-M-intro`, `335-M-oop`) [Deck]

- Programming moved from unstructured, to structured, to object-oriented code.
- **Encapsulation** bundles data with the methods that use it and hides the representation behind a controlled interface.
- **Inheritance** means "is-a": a subclass reuses and extends a superclass.
- **Polymorphism:** one interface, many implementations. The method that runs is chosen by the object's **runtime** type.
- **Cohesion** should be high: a class does one job. **Coupling** should be low: a class depends on few things, preferably through interfaces.

**Worked example.** A `BankAccount` that only manages its balance is cohesive. If it also renders UI and sends email, cohesion is low. A UI that uses a concrete `MysqlBankStore` everywhere is tightly coupled; depending on a `BankStore` interface is loosely coupled.

### Classes 1 (`335-M-classes1`) [Deck]

- **Composition ("has-a")** means the part's lifetime is owned by the whole. In UML it is a **filled diamond on the whole's side**.
- **Aggregation** is a weaker has-a, drawn with a hollow diamond. **Association** is a plain line. **Inheritance** is a hollow triangle pointing to the superclass. **Interface realization** is a dashed line with a hollow triangle.
- **UML class box:** the name, then fields, then methods. `-` means private, `+` public, `#` protected.
- **Information hiding:** fields are private, with accessors only where needed, and no leaking of mutable internals.

### Testing & Javadoc (`335-M-testing`) [Deck]

- **Unit tests** check one class or method in isolation. **Integration tests** check parts working together.
- **Black-box** tests come from the specification. **White-box** tests come from the code's paths and branches.
- **JUnit:** a fixture method runs before each test, `@Test` marks tests, and assertions check results. Tests should be independent of each other and of their order.

| | JUnit 4 (deck style) | JUnit 5 |
|---|---|---|
| Before each test | `@Before` | `@BeforeEach` |
| After each test | `@After` | `@AfterEach` |
| Expecting an exception | `@Test(expected = X.class)` | `assertThrows(X.class, () -> ...)` |

- Java `assert` statements are **disabled by default**; enable them with `-ea`. JUnit assertions are separate from `assert`.
- **Javadoc** uses `/** ... */` with `@param`, `@return`, and `@throws`. Document every public class and method.

### Classes 2 (`335-M-classes2`) [Deck]

- **Static** members belong to the class and are shared by all instances. **Instance** members belong to each object.
- **Overriding** replaces an inherited method with the same signature, chosen at runtime. **Overloading** means same name, different parameters, chosen at compile time.
- `super(...)` calls the parent constructor and must come first in the constructor. `super.m()` calls the parent's version of `m`.
- **Exceptions:**
  - Checked exceptions (such as `IOException`) must be caught or declared with `throws`.
  - Unchecked exceptions (`RuntimeException` subclasses such as `IllegalArgumentException`) do not need to be.
  - A `finally` block always runs, even after a `return`.

### Lambdas (`335-M-lambdas`) [Syllabus-only]

- An **anonymous class** implements an interface inline: `new Comparator<String>() { public int compare(...) {...} }`.
- A **lambda** is a shorter form for a **functional interface** (one abstract method): `(a, b) -> a.length() - b.length()`.
- A **method reference** is shorter still: `String::length`, `System.out::println`.
- Lambdas can use local variables only if they are **effectively final**.

### Generics (`335-M-generics`) [Syllabus-only]

- `class Box<T> { private T item; ... }` is type-safe reuse, checked at compile time. There is no casting, and wrong types are caught early.
- **Type erasure:** generic type information is removed at runtime, so `new T()` and `List<int>` are not allowed. Use `List<Integer>`, which relies on autoboxing.
- **Bounded types:** `<T extends Comparable<T>>` lets you call `compareTo` on T.
- **Design patterns** are named, reusable solutions to recurring design problems. A **framework** calls your code ("inversion of control"), whereas you call a library.

### Collections, Iterator, Template Method (`335-M-collections`) [Syllabus-only]

**Collections Framework:**
- `List` is ordered and allows duplicates (`ArrayList`, `LinkedList`).
- `Set` has no duplicates (`HashSet`, `TreeSet` sorted).
- `Map` stores key→value pairs (`HashMap`, `TreeMap`).
- `Queue` and `Deque` support FIFO and LIFO use.

**`equals` and `hashCode`.** If you override `equals`, you must also override `hashCode`, or `HashSet` and `HashMap` will misbehave.

**Iterator pattern.** Traverse a collection without exposing its internals, using `hasNext()` and `next()`. Removing an element during a for-each loop throws `ConcurrentModificationException`; use `iterator.remove()` instead.

**Template Method pattern.** A superclass method defines the fixed **skeleton** of an algorithm and calls abstract or "hook" steps that subclasses override. The skeleton is often `final`.

### JavaFX, Observer, Composite (`335-M-javafx-obs`) [Syllabus-only]

- **JavaFX structure:** a `Stage` (the window) holds a `Scene`, which holds a tree of `Node`s. Layout panes include `BorderPane`, `VBox`, and `HBox`. Event handlers are often lambdas: `button.setOnAction(e -> ...)`.
- **Observer pattern.** A subject keeps a list of observers and notifies them when it changes. This decouples a model from its views. (Java's old `Observable` class is deprecated; lectures may still show it.)
- **Composite pattern.** Treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly through a shared interface. A group holds children and forwards operations to them. A JavaFX scene graph is an example: a `Pane` contains `Node`s and is itself a `Node`.

## 4. Practice questions (core)

**P1 (recall).** Define encapsulation in one sentence.

**P2 (explain).** Why are high cohesion and low coupling both desirable?

**P3 (UML).** Sketch UML for a `Library` that is composed of many `Book`s.

**P4 (testing).** Write a test expecting `deposit(-5)` to throw `IllegalArgumentException`.

**P5 (recall).** What is the difference between black-box and white-box testing?

**P6 (Javadoc).** Write Javadoc for `E pop()` on a stack that throws `EmptyStackException` when empty.

**P7 (explain).** When should a method be an instance method rather than static?

**P8 (trace).** `Dog extends Animal`, and both define `speak()`. Which version runs for `Animal a = new Dog(); a.speak();`?

**P9 (recall).** When is the midterm, and what is still unverified?

**P10 (explain).** Why is P3 not treated as confirmed study material in this guide?

---

## 4b. Written-exam practice — generic shapes (**not** Gradescope-derived)

**Where this format comes from.** CSC 335 has no Gradescope, and its midterm format is unpublished. These items use generic written-exam shapes: short answer, code tracing, code writing, UML, and tests. **This is a practice recommendation, not an inferred format.**

**Timed mock (Mon Oct 5):** do T1–T4, W1–W3, and S1–S4 in **50 minutes** on paper.

### Code tracing

**T1 (static vs instance).** What does this print?

```java
class Counter {
  static int total = 0;
  int mine = 0;
  void hit() { total++; mine++; }
}
Counter a = new Counter(), b = new Counter();
a.hit(); a.hit(); b.hit();
System.out.println(a.mine + " " + b.mine + " " + Counter.total);
```

**T2 (dynamic dispatch through a superclass method).** What does this print?

```java
class Animal {
  String speak() { return "..."; }
  String intro() { return "I say " + speak(); }
}
class Cat extends Animal {
  @Override String speak() { return "meow"; }
}
Animal x = new Cat();
System.out.println(x.intro());
```

**T3 (exceptions and finally).** What do `f(-1)` and `f(5)` print?

```java
static int f(int x) {
  try {
    if (x < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    return 1;
  } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
    return 2;
  } finally {
    System.out.print("F ");
  }
}
System.out.println(f(-1));
System.out.println(f(5));
```

**T4 (overloading vs overriding).** What does this print?

```java
class P { void m(Object o) { System.out.println("P-Object"); } }
class C extends P {
  void m(Object o) { System.out.println("C-Object"); }
  void m(String s) { System.out.println("C-String"); }
}
P p = new C();
p.m("hi");
```

### Code writing

**W1 (encapsulation fix).** Rewrite this class so the balance can never go negative and cannot be set directly:

```java
public class Account { public double balance; }
```

**W2 (lambda / comparator).** Sort a `List<String> names` by length, then alphabetically for ties, using a lambda or `Comparator` methods.

**W3 (generics).** Write a generic static method `max` that returns the largest element of a non-empty `List<T>`, where T is `Comparable`.

### Short answer

**S1.** Name the pattern: (a) a spreadsheet cell's charts update whenever the cell changes; (b) a `Folder` contains `File`s and other `Folder`s, and `size()` works on both; (c) a base `Game.play()` fixes the order `setup(); takeTurns(); scoreboard();`, and subclasses fill in the steps.

**S2.** Why must `hashCode` be overridden whenever `equals` is?

**S3.** Checked or unchecked: `IOException`, `NullPointerException`, `IllegalArgumentException`, `FileNotFoundException`.

**S4.** Write three JUnit test *names* (not bodies) for a `Stack<E>` that cover normal use, an edge case, and an error case.

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->

## 5. ANSWER KEY

### Core keys

**A1.** Bundle data with the methods that use it, and hide the internal representation behind a controlled interface.

**A2.** Cohesive classes are easier to understand, test, and change. Low coupling limits ripple effects when something changes.

**A3.** `Library` (filled diamond) composition to `Book`, multiplicity many (UML star, or 0..star) on the Book end. Follow the Classes 1 deck's notation.

**A4.**

```java
// JUnit 4
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void depositNegativeThrows() { acct.deposit(-5); }

// JUnit 5
@Test
void depositNegativeThrows() {
  assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> acct.deposit(-5));
}
```

**A5.** Black-box tests are derived from the specification and inputs/outputs, without looking at the code. White-box tests use the code's structure, aiming to cover its branches and paths.

**A6.**

```java
/**
 * Removes and returns the top element of this stack.
 *
 * @return the element that was on top
 * @throws EmptyStackException if the stack is empty
 */
public E pop() { ... }
```

**A7.** When the behavior depends on, or changes, a particular object's state.

**A8.** `Dog.speak()`. The runtime type decides (dynamic dispatch).

**A9.** Thu Oct 8, 2026, in the class period. Still unverified: the clock time, format, materials, and published scope.

**A10.** The syllabus lists P3, but it is missing from D2L Assignments, so it is marked **Needs verification**, and no study time is planned around it.

### Written-exam keys

**T1.** `2 1 3`

**T2.** `I say meow`. `intro()` is inherited, but `speak()` dispatches on the runtime type, which is `Cat`.

**T3.** `F 2` then `F 1`. `finally` prints before each returned value reaches `println`.

**T4.** `C-Object`. Overload resolution happens at **compile time** using the static type `P`, which only has `m(Object)`. At runtime, the override in `C` runs.

**W1.**

```java
public class Account {
  private double balance;

  public double getBalance() { return balance; }

  public void deposit(double amt) {
    if (amt <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("amount must be positive");
    balance += amt;
  }

  public void withdraw(double amt) {
    if (amt <= 0 || amt > balance) throw new IllegalArgumentException("invalid amount");
    balance -= amt;
  }
}
```

**W2.**

```java
names.sort(Comparator.comparing(String::length)
                     .thenComparing(Comparator.naturalOrder()));
```

An equivalent lambda:

```java
names.sort((a, b) -> a.length() != b.length()
    ? Integer.compare(a.length(), b.length())
    : a.compareTo(b));
```

**W3.**

```java
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> T max(List<T> xs) {
  T best = xs.get(0);
  for (T x : xs) if (x.compareTo(best) > 0) best = x;
  return best;
}
```

**S1.** (a) Observer. (b) Composite. (c) Template Method.

**S2.** Equal objects must have equal hash codes. Otherwise hash-based collections (`HashSet`, `HashMap`) look in the wrong bucket and miss "equal" objects, which produces duplicates or failed lookups.

**S3.** `IOException`: checked. `NullPointerException`: unchecked. `IllegalArgumentException`: unchecked. `FileNotFoundException`: checked (it is a subclass of `IOException`).

**S4.** For example: `pushThenPopReturnsSameItem`, `newStackIsEmpty`, `popOnEmptyThrows`.

## 6. Common mistakes + readiness

- Confusing inheritance ("is-a") with composition ("has-a"), or putting the UML diamond on the wrong end.
- Public fields "just this once."
- Tests that depend on the order they run in, or that share mutable state without a before-each fixture.
- Forgetting Javadoc on public API.
- Catching generic `Exception` and swallowing it.
- Confusing overloading (chosen at compile time) with overriding (chosen at runtime). See T4.
- Overriding `equals` without `hashCode`.
- Modifying a collection inside a for-each loop.

**Readiness:** a blind pass over all nine IDs, one UML redraw, three JUnit tests written, the 50-minute mock, and a light mixed review on Wed Oct 7 — **no cram on Wednesday night**.

## 7. Day-by-day prep

The same day as CSC 345 Exam 1, so split effort. Prefer Mon/Wed/Fri and weekends for 335.

| Day | Focus | IDs |
|-----|-------|-----|
| Fri Oct 2 | Intro, OOP, Classes 1 | intro, oop, classes1 |
| Sat Oct 3 | Testing, Classes 2, lambdas | testing, classes2, lambdas |
| Sun Oct 4 | Generics, collections, patterns, JavaFX | generics, collections, javafx-obs |
| Mon Oct 5 | **50-minute mock** (§4b), then retake misses | all |
| Tue Oct 6 | Optional light flash (the 337 midterm is today) | — |
| Wed Oct 7 | Light mixed review, not a cram | all, light |
| Thu Oct 8 morning | Calm buffer only | — |

## 8. Changes in this review (2026-09-24)

- **Filled the scope gap.** The banner says "syllabus weeks 1–6", but the old guide covered only the week 1–3 decks. Added `335-M-lambdas`, `335-M-generics`, `335-M-collections`, and `335-M-javafx-obs`. Each is tagged **[Syllabus-only]**, because no deck was observed; they use standard Java and Gang-of-Four definitions.
- Added a JUnit 4 vs JUnit 5 table, since the deck uses `@Before`, and made the P4 key show both styles.
- Added generic written-exam practice (T1–T4, W1–W3, S1–S4) with keys. It is explicitly **not** Gradescope-derived.
- Changed "closed-book" to **verify**, and noted the possible back-to-back schedule with the CSC 345 exam.
- Improved UML notation guidance (composition, aggregation, inheritance, realization).
- Changed times to Arizona time.
