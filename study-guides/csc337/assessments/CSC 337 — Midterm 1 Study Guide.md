## 3. Plain explanations + worked examples

### Overview + HTTP (`337-M1-overview`, `337-M1-http`)

- **Three client-side layers:** HTML is structure and content, CSS is presentation, and JavaScript is behavior.
- **URL parts:** in `https://example.com:443/shop/items?id=7#reviews`, the scheme is `https`, the host is `example.com`, the port is `443`, the path is `/shop/items`, the query is `id=7`, and the fragment is `reviews`. The browser keeps the fragment; it is never sent to the server.
- **HTTP exchange:** the client sends a request (method, path, headers, optional body). The server replies with a response (status code, headers, optional body). HTTPS is HTTP over TLS encryption.
- **Status code families:** 2xx success (200 OK), 3xx redirect (301, 302), 4xx client error (404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden), and 5xx server error (500).

### HTML (`337-M1-html`)

- A document has `<!DOCTYPE html>`, then `<html lang="en">` containing `<head>` (`<meta charset>`, `<title>`, CSS `<link>`) and `<body>`.
- Semantic elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`) describe meaning. `div` and `span` are generic containers; `div` is block-level and `span` is inline.
- Attributes: `id` must be unique on the page, while a `class` can be reused. `<img>` needs `alt` text. `<a href>` makes links.

### CSS (`337-M1-css`, `337-M1-layout`)

**Specificity** is compared as a tuple (ids, classes/attributes/pseudo-classes, elements), from left to right:

| Selector | Tuple |
|----------|-------|
| `p` | (0,0,1) |
| `.note` | (0,1,0) |
| `div.note` | (0,1,1) |
| `#main` | (1,0,0) |
| `ul li.active a` | (0,1,3) |
| `nav > a:hover` | (0,1,2) |

Inline `style=""` beats all of these, and `!important` overrides normal rules; avoid relying on it. When specificity ties, the rule that appears **later** wins.

**Box model:** content, then padding, then border, then margin.
- With `box-sizing: content-box` (the default), `width` sets the content only, so total width = width + left/right padding + left/right border.
- With `border-box`, `width` already includes padding and border.

**Layout:** normal flow (block elements stack; inline elements flow in a line), then flexbox (`display:flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`), grid, and positioning (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`), as taught.

### Forms (`337-M1-forms`)

- `<form action="/search" method="get">` holds the controls. Each control's `name` attribute becomes the parameter key.
- Pair each control with a label: `<label for="email">` matches `<input id="email">`.
- Common input types: `text`, `email`, `number`, `password`, `checkbox`, `radio` (same `name` makes a group), `submit`, plus `<select>` and `<textarea>`.
- Built-in validation attributes include `required`, `min`, `max`, and `pattern`. JavaScript validation can check anything and show a message in the page.

### Get & Post (`337-M1-getpost`) — added in this review (syllabus week 4)

| | GET | POST |
|---|-----|------|
| Where the data goes | In the URL query string (`?q=cats&page=2`) | In the request body |
| Visible and bookmarkable? | Yes, and it is cached and kept in history | No |
| Typical use | Retrieving, search, filters | Creating or changing data, logins, larger payloads |
| Size | Limited by URL length | Much larger |

POST is **not** encryption. Only HTTPS protects the data in transit.

### JavaScript (`337-M1-js`)

- **Declarations:** `let` and `const` are block-scoped; `var` is function-scoped. `const` stops reassignment but not mutation of an object's contents.
- **Equality:** `===` is strict (no type conversion). `==` converts types first, so `0 == ""` is `true`. Use `===`.
- **Types:** `+` with any string concatenates (`1 + "2"` gives `"12"`). Other arithmetic converts to numbers (`"3" * 2` gives `6`).
- **Sorting:** `arr.sort()` compares values **as strings** by default, so `[10, 9, 1].sort()` gives `[1, 10, 9]`. For numbers use `arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)`.
- **Parsing input:** `Number("")` is `0`, not `NaN`. Check for empty input separately. `Number("12px")` is `NaN`, while `parseInt("12px")` is `12`.
- **Events:** `el.addEventListener("click", handler)` passes the function itself. Writing `handler()` there calls it immediately, which is a bug.

### DOM (`337-M1-dom`) — week 6, not yet lectured

- Select elements with `document.getElementById("x")` or `document.querySelector(".card")`.
- Change content with `el.textContent = "..."`, which is safe plain text. `el.innerHTML = "..."` parses HTML, so avoid it with user input.
- Build elements with `document.createElement("li")`, then `parent.appendChild(li)`.
- Change styles and classes with `el.classList.add("hidden")`, or directly with `el.style.color = "red"`.

### Client/server (`337-M1-client-server`) — conceptual only

- The client (browser) sends requests; the server holds data and logic and returns responses.
- A **static** page is the same file for everyone. A **dynamic** response is generated per request.
- Client-side JavaScript runs in the browser, so users can see and change it. Validation there improves the user experience but **must be repeated on the server** for security.
- **Stop here.** Server frameworks (Node, Express) and databases are weeks 8+.

---

## 4. Practice questions (core)

**P1 (recall).** Name the three client-side layers and give one responsibility of each.

**P2 (explain).** What does an HTTP response contain besides the body?

**P3 (code).** Write a minimal valid HTML page with an external stylesheet `site.css` and a script `main.js` that runs after the page's elements exist.

**P4 (CSS).** Which is more specific, `div.note` or `#main`? Give both tuples.

**P5 (box).** An element has `width: 100px`, `padding: 10px`, and `border: 1px solid`, with content-box sizing. What is its total rendered width? What is it under border-box?

**P6 (forms).** Write a form with a labelled email input (required) and a submit button that sends a GET request to `/subscribe`.

**P7 (Get & Post).** A search form uses GET with fields `q=red shoes` and `size=9`. Write the URL the browser requests from `/search`. What changes if the form uses POST instead?

**P8 (JS).** A user types `"12, 3, 100"`. Outline the steps to show the numbers sorted ascending, and name the trap in the default `sort()`.

**P9 (explain).** Why must input validated in client-side JavaScript be checked again on the server?

**P10 (recall).** When is Midterm 1, and how long is it?

**P11 (explain).** Why does this guide avoid inventing Node or MongoDB content for the "client/server" topic?

## 4b. Gradescope-format and midterm-style practice — **Practice recommendation**

**Where this format comes from.** The Gradescope format notes show short ICA checks (10 points each) and multi-page assignments graded per page (Assignment 3: four rubric questions x 25 points, shown as Page 1–4). They do **not** show a midterm format, which is unpublished. The mix below (recall, trace, write code, short explain) is a generic 75-minute written-exam shape. Treat it as a recommendation, not a claimed format.

**Timed mock (Sun Oct 4):** do R1–R4, T1–T4, and W1–W2 in **45 minutes**, on paper, closed-book.

### Short recall (ICA grain)

**GS-337-R1.** Order by specificity, lowest to highest: `.card`, `div`, `#app`, `div.card`, `#app .card`.

**GS-337-R2.** What does `el.textContent = "<b>Hi</b>"` display, compared with `el.innerHTML = "<b>Hi</b>"`? Which is safer with user input, and why?

**GS-337-R3.** Match each status code to its meaning: 200, 301, 404, 500.

**GS-337-R4.** Give two differences between GET and POST.

### Output tracing

**GS-337-T1.** What does this log?

```js
console.log(1 + "2", "3" * 2, 0 == "", 0 === "");
```

**GS-337-T2.** What does this log?

```js
let s = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) continue;
  s += i;
}
console.log(s);
```

**GS-337-T3.** What does this log, and how do you get numeric order?

```js
const a = [10, 9, 1, 100];
a.sort();
console.log(a);
```

**GS-337-T4.** After one full outer pass (`i = 0`) of this bubble sort, what is `a`?

```js
const a = [5, 2, 4, 1];
for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++)
  for (let j = 0; j < a.length - 1 - i; j++)
    if (a[j] > a[j + 1]) { const t = a[j]; a[j] = a[j + 1]; a[j + 1] = t; }
```

**GS-337-T5.** Count letters case-insensitively in `"Mississippi"`. What are the counts?

### Write code (DOM + events)

**GS-337-W1.** Given `<input id="n"> <button id="go">Double</button> <p id="out"></p>`, write JavaScript so that clicking the button shows twice the number, or `Not a number` for empty or invalid input.

**GS-337-W2.** Write `validZip(s)`, which returns `true` only for exactly 5 digits. This is a practice spec, deliberately different from any assignment.

### Short explain

**GS-337-E1.** A number-guessing page picks a secret from 1 to 100. With the best strategy (always guess the middle), what is the maximum number of guesses needed? Why?

**GS-337-E2.** You submit a multi-file web assignment on Gradescope. What two checks prevent a zero for "missing file"? This is process, not content.

### ICA habit (process)

The format notes show every submitted ICA earned full credit, but two ICAs had **no submission**, an upload miss rather than a content gap. The habit to build: upload each ICA before 11:00 PM on lecture day. No extra ICA content drilling is needed.


## 4c. ICA-style micro practice — **Practice recommendation**

**Where this comes from.** Content ICA1-ICA10 (D2L Content-pass). These are **new** short items in the same grain (URL parts, HTML/CSS write, box model, forms, JS/DOM). They are not copies of ICA PDFs. Midterm format remains unpublished.

**ICA-M1 (URL; ICA2 grain).** For `https://docs.arizona.edu/csc337/fa26/schedule/?week=5#forms`, name scheme, domain, path, query, fragment. Which part is not sent to the server?

**ICA-M2 (HTML+CSS; ICA3 grain).** Write a minimal page with an unordered list of three animals and yellow body background (inline style or `<style>`).

**ICA-M3 (forms; ICA3 grain).** Gender (one choice) vs hobbies (many choices): radio or checkbox for each?

**ICA-M4 (CSS selectors; ICA5 grain).** Given elements with ids `taylor`, `martin`, `pearl`, `gretsch` and classes `guitar` / `drums`, which rule set colors **all** of them (not just some)? Sketch a correct rule set.

**ICA-M5 (box model; ICA6 grain).** Write a rule for `div.box` with margin 10px top/bottom and 15px left/right; border 2px solid black; padding 5px top/bottom and 10px left/right.

**ICA-M6 (show/hide; ICA7 grain).** (a) JS to show `#my_div` currently `display:none`. (b) CSS to hide `#my_p` with `visibility`. (c) One difference between `display:none` and `visibility:hidden`.

**ICA-M7 (JS; ICA8-9 grain).** (a) Min of a number list without `Math.min`. (b) Round a float to two decimals with `Math.round`. (c) Word-count object for a sentence split on spaces.

**ICA-M8 (events+DOM; ICA10 grain).** Textbox `#t` and div `#count`: on each input, show the current character length in `#count` using `textContent`.

## 4d. Assignments 1-3 as practice context (no solutions)

Content Assignments 1-3 are completed topics for self-review. Use them as a **topic checklist**, not as something to re-solve here:

| Assignment | Practice-context themes (study the skills, do not paste solutions) |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A1 | Multi-page HTML site; nav links; images+alt; tables; inline styles |
| A2 | Theme / style toggles; contrast text; localStorage vs non-persistent state |
| A3 | Inline vs block; id/class styling; positioning/float; margin vs padding; `visibility` vs `display`; simple onload/onclick JS |

**A4** remains open and individual — topic overlap only; no A4 solutions in this guide.

## 5. ANSWER KEY

### Core keys

**A1.** HTML gives structure and content, CSS gives presentation and layout, and JavaScript gives behavior and interactivity.

**A2.** A status line (code and reason, such as `200 OK`) and headers (such as `Content-Type`, `Set-Cookie`, and caching). The body is the payload.

**A3.**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Demo</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="site.css">
  <script src="main.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hi</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

`defer` in `<head>` works, and so does placing the `<script>` as the last element inside `<body>`.

**A4.** `#main` is (1,0,0) and `div.note` is (0,1,1). Ids beat any number of classes, so `#main` is more specific.

**A5.** Content-box: 100 + 2·10 + 2·1 = **122px**. Border-box: **100px**, with content shrunk to 100 - 20 - 2 = 78px.

**A6.**

```html
<form action="/subscribe" method="get">
  <label for="em">Email</label>
  <input type="email" id="em" name="email" required>
  <button type="submit">Subscribe</button>
</form>
```

**A7.** `/search?q=red+shoes&size=9`. The space is encoded as `+` or `%20`. With POST, the URL is just `/search`, and `q=red+shoes&size=9` travels in the request body, so it is not visible in the URL or history.

**A8.** Steps:
1. Split on `,`.
2. Trim each piece and convert it with `Number`.
3. Reject `NaN` values.
4. Sort with `(a, b) => a - b`.
5. Display the result with `textContent` or a textarea value.

The trap: the default `sort()` compares strings, so it gives `[100, 12, 3]`.

**A9.** Client code runs on the user's machine and can be bypassed, for example by disabling JavaScript or sending a request directly. Only server checks are trustworthy. Client checks exist for fast feedback.

**A10.** Tue Oct 6, 2026, in the 75-minute class period (3:30–4:45 PM Arizona).

**A11.** The scope is provisional, and the only published topic label is "client/server model" (week 7). Node, Express, and MongoDB are scheduled for weeks 8+ and have not been taught, so inventing detail would mean studying the wrong material.


### ICA-micro keys (ICA-M1 to ICA-M8)

**ICA-M1.** scheme `https`; domain `docs.arizona.edu`; path `/csc337/fa26/schedule/`; query `week=5`; fragment `forms`. Fragment is not sent to the server.

**ICA-M2.** Example shape: `<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>...</title><style>body{background:yellow;}</style></head><body><ul><li>cats</li><li>dogs</li><li>birds</li></ul></body></html>`.

**ICA-M3.** (a) radio (one of a group). (b) checkbox (multi-select).

**ICA-M4.** Need rules that hit every element — e.g. `.guitar { color: green; } #pearl { color: blue; } #gretsch { color: yellow; }` (or one rule per id). A lone `.guitar` plus `#drums` fails (no id `drums`; class is `drums`).

**ICA-M5.**
```css
div.box {
  margin: 10px 15px;
  border: 2px solid black;
  padding: 5px 10px;
}
```

**ICA-M6.** (a) `document.getElementById("my_div").style.display = "block";` (or `""`). (b) `#my_p { visibility: hidden; }`. (c) `display:none` removes layout space; `visibility:hidden` hides but keeps the space.

**ICA-M7.** (a) Loop comparing, track min. (b) `Math.round(x * 100) / 100`. (c) Split on `" "`, count into an object `{}`.

**ICA-M8.**
```js
document.getElementById("t").addEventListener("input", () => {
  document.getElementById("count").textContent =
    String(document.getElementById("t").value.length);
});
```

### Gradescope-format keys

**GS-337-R1.** `div` (0,0,1) < `.card` (0,1,0) < `div.card` (0,1,1) < `#app` (1,0,0) < `#app .card` (1,1,0).

**GS-337-R2.** `textContent` shows the literal text `<b>Hi</b>`. `innerHTML` renders a bold **Hi**. `textContent` is safer, because `innerHTML` with user input can inject markup or scripts (XSS).

**GS-337-R3.** 200 = OK. 301 = moved permanently (redirect). 404 = not found. 500 = internal server error.

**GS-337-R4.** Any two of:
- GET puts data in the URL; POST puts it in the body.
- GET is visible, bookmarkable, and cached; POST is not.
- GET is for retrieval; POST is for creating or changing data.
- GET is limited by URL length.

**GS-337-T1.** `12 6 true false`

**GS-337-T2.** `9` (1 + 3 + 5).

**GS-337-T3.** `[1, 10, 100, 9]`, because the values are compared as strings. Fix: `a.sort((x, y) => x - y)` gives `[1, 9, 10, 100]`.

**GS-337-T4.** `[5,2,4,1]` -> `[2,5,4,1]` -> `[2,4,5,1]` -> `[2,4,1,5]`. After the pass, `a` is **`[2, 4, 1, 5]`**, and the largest value has bubbled to the end.

**GS-337-T5.** m: 1, i: 4, s: 4, p: 2 (11 letters total).

**GS-337-W1.**

```js
document.getElementById("go").addEventListener("click", () => {
  const raw = document.getElementById("n").value.trim();
  const out = document.getElementById("out");
  const v = Number(raw);
  out.textContent = (raw === "" || Number.isNaN(v)) ? "Not a number" : String(v * 2);
});
```

The key points are passing the handler without `()`, trimming the input, catching the empty-string trap, and using `textContent`.

**GS-337-W2.**

```js
function validZip(s) {
  return /^\d{5}$/.test(s);
}
```

A loop that checks `s.length === 5` and that every character is between `'0'` and `'9'` is also fine.

**GS-337-E1.** **7 guesses.** Each guess halves the remaining range, and 2^6 = 64 < 100 <= 128 = 2^7.

**GS-337-E2.** (1) Upload **every** required file, with filenames exactly as the assignment PDF lists them. (2) Open the submission page afterwards to confirm all files are there. Also check the deadline: assignments are due at **3:30 PM**, not 11:59 PM.

## 6. Common mistakes + readiness

- Invalid nesting, or a `label` whose `for` doesn't match the input's `id`.
- Fighting specificity with `!important` instead of writing a clearer selector.
- Assuming border-box sizing when the default is content-box.
- Thinking POST is "secure." Only HTTPS encrypts.
- Using `==` instead of `===`, or forgetting that `Number("")` is `0`.
- Sorting numbers with the default `sort()`.
- `addEventListener("click", f())`, which calls `f` immediately.
- Using `innerHTML` with user text.

**Readiness:** a blind pass over all **11** section IDs, the 45-minute paper mock (§4b), and a light review on Monday night — no cram.

---

## 7. Day-by-day prep (Tue/Thu light; no day-before cram)

| Day | Focus | IDs | Notes |
|-----|-------|-----|-------|
| Tue Sep 29 | — | — | A4 due 3:30 PM. This guide does not cover A4. |
| Wed Sep 30 | HTTP, URLs, Get & Post | http, getpost | Short |
| Fri Oct 2 | HTML and CSS review | html, css, layout | Deep day |
| Sat Oct 3 | Forms, JS, and DOM (after the week-6 lecture) | forms, js, dom | Deep day |
| Sun Oct 4 | **45-minute paper mock** (§4b), then review | integrate | Blind, then check |
| Mon Oct 5 | Even rotation over all IDs; client/server concepts | all `337-M1-*` | Deep day, but stop by evening |
| **Tue Oct 6** | Calm buffer only | — | Midterm in class at 3:30 PM |

## 8. Changes in this review (2026-09-24)

- Added **Get & Post** (syllabus week 4), which was missing from the checklist. It now has an explanation, practice items, and keys.
- **Removed Assignment 4–specific solution material:** the working email validator for A4's exact rule, A4's exact validation list, and A4's filenames. A4 is open and individual-only. The drills are re-specified: ZIP validator, letter counts, a DOM "double" button, and guess-count reasoning.
- Added a timing caveat: DOM and client/server have not been lectured yet, and client/server falls in the midterm week itself.
- Marked "closed-book" as **verify**, because the inventory and topic map don't state it.
- Rebuilt the specificity explanation with tuples, and added JavaScript traps (`==`, `Number("")`, default `sort`, event handler), DOM safety, and status codes.
- Fixed the readiness line: it said "all eight IDs" when there were ten; there are now eleven.
- Changed times to Arizona time.


## 8b. Content-fold (2026-09-24, America/Phoenix)

- Mapped Content slides 02-08 onto the existing topic IDs; kept honesty banners (scope PROVISIONAL; date confirmed Oct 6).
- Added ICA-style micro practice ICA-M1..M8 (**Practice recommendation**) from Content ICA grain without copying ICA PDFs.
- Added A1-A3 practice-context table (skills only); A4 still open/individual, no solutions.

## 9. Disclaimer

The Gradescope format notes describe ICA and assignment formats only. The midterm format and blueprint are **not published**, so the §4b shape is a recommendation.
